# Polynomial Constant Finder

This project contains a JavaScript program, `polynomial.js`, which calculates the constant term of a polynomial given a set of roots in various numerical bases. The calculation is done using Lagrange interpolation.

## Project Structure

- `polynomial.js` - Contains the main code for decoding roots and calculating the polynomial's constant term.

## How It Works

The program reads a JSON input that specifies polynomial roots in various bases. It decodes these roots and uses Lagrange interpolation to calculate the constant term of the polynomial.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't cloned the repository yet, you can do so with:
